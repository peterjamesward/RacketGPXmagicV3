# TODO

Post-process for distance, gradient etc.

Profile view under map. (Use my colours.)

Display track in OpenGL window (see RobotMaze).

Start to put views into child windows. (Switch between floating and docked, somehow).

Increase map zoom limit (is 18, need 21).
Colour track.
Show track points.

Tools, could actually be objects, subclassed from base-tool, say.

Drag on map.

> Likewaise, we can probably make a better marker.

See if we can promote child windows into top level.

Need: equivalent of elm-geometry, some of which is in Pict3D.

Most graphic attributes to live at window level (e.g. terrain).

# DONE

GPX -> Map, zoomed, centred, "orange" marker.
