## Design goals

Learn from v2 and particularly from v2.8 (heavy use of closures there).

Native desktop app, hoping for more control over processing and memory use.

Multiple windows, multiple monitors.

Rationalised and reorganised tools.

## Implementation choices

Racket looks ideal. Plenty of useful prior art. Should adapt to Lisp syntax OK.
Looked at Haskell, but ecosystem is still a problem for impatient newbies.
